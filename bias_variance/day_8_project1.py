# Scenario: Predicting Student Exam Scores
# A school wants to build a model to predict student exam scores based on study hours. They collect data
# from 30 students, but the scores are noisy because of other factors (like sleep, stress, or health).
# They try two different models:
# - Linear Model (straight line) → very simple, assumes scores increase perfectly with study hours.
# - Polynomial Model (degree 10 curve) → very complex, tries to follow every bump in the data.

# Questions
# - Part A: If the linear model consistently predicts too low or too high compared to actual scores,
# what does this show about bias?
# - Part B: If the polynomial model fits the training data almost perfectly but gives very different 
# predictions when tested on new students, what does this show about variance?
# - Part C: Which model is likely to generalize better to new students, and why?
# - Part D (Applied): How would you explain the difference between “high bias” and “high variance” to
#  a teacher who doesn’t know machine learning?
